# Smart-Surgical-Headlights-using-hand-gesture
I have made a contactless control device for Surgical Illumination, Videorecording and its distribution to multiple screens. I have tried to make it using IoT as well as computer vision application for its development along.
I have used several video recording and sharing code using OpenCV, Client-Server Model, Microcontroller based gesture execution in Arduino.
